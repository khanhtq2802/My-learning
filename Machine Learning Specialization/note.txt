course 1:
regression
supervised vs unsupervised learning
gradient descent, adam
cost function

multiple linear regression
numpy
Multi Variate regression
feature scaling
feature engineering

logistic regression
classification
sigmoid function
decision boundary
logistic loss
overfitting - high variance
underfitting - high bias
regularization

course 2:
neural networds
tensorflow
neurons and layers
neural networds for binary classification

neural networds training
activation functions
multiclass classification
convolutional layers
fully connected layer
relu 
softmax
multiclass classification

diagnostic
training set, cross validation set, test set
bias and variance
baseline level of performance
fixes high variance: get more training examples, try smaller sets of feature, try increasing lambda
fixes high bias: try getting additional features, try adding polynomial features, try decreasing lambda
error analysis: manually examine a sample of the training examples that the model misclassified in order to identify common traits and trends
data augmentation
transfer learning

decision trees
entropy
infomation gradient
one hot encoding
sampling with replacement
tree ensemble
unstructured data and structured data

course 3:
clustering: K means
anomaly detection

collaborative filtering
recommender systems
content-based filtering

reinforcement learning
state-action value function
continuous state spaces
